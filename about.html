   <div class="about-para">
   <p>Hi! My name is Hila M. Badescu Knal. I'm a student of English and Linguistics at the University of Oregon, and am 
      very passionate about both of these topics! I was born and raised in a small town in Israel but have been living in 
      Oregon for the past three and a half years (and I absolutely love it here!) I speak Hebrew and English fluently, some Russian 
      from childhood, and am currently learning French! I'm very passionate about languages and language learning, and love to 
      talk about anything else linguistics-related! I work at a small school teaching Hebrew part-time, and I find my job incredibly
      fulfulling, but also tiring! Other than that, I have many hobbies that I like to do both by myself and With
      others. One of my earliest an longest passions has been art. I love painting with guache, acrylic, and watercolors, as well
      as drawing with oil pastels, alcohol markers, and paint markers. I absolutely love and art with bright colors and a 
      cheerful make-up! I also really appreciate animaion, and enjoy watching lots and lots of animated shows and movies. Some 
      of my favorites include: Adventure Time, Over The Garden Wall, the Tinkerbell movie franchise, and any Studio Ghibli films! 
      I also have, like, a crazy obsession with stickers. I collect stickers from everywhere I travel and have a sticker book with hundreds
      of stickers and sticker sheets. I love taking care of houseplants (and probably have way too many of them), and I love going
      on walks and hikes in nature! Some of my other hobbies include baking and cooking (which I most love doing with my partner!), 
      playing video games, and, of course, reading! </p>
      <p>I created this web page to share my love of books and literature and hope to influence others to read more!
      One of the most important lessons I've learned over my years as both a reader and a teacher is that there is a 
      book out there for everyone! I think people get way too caught up these days on which books are 
      'good' and which are 'bad' to read, but the truth is that all reading is valuable and if you're having fun, you're 
      doing it right! For example, I spent a lot of time avoiding reading comics and graphic novels (after having absolutely 
      adored them as a kid) because I was taught that they aren't "real books" and that they're not worth spending time on, 
      but once I got back into them, I found that they are such a creative, beautiful, and unique form of art and storytelling that's
      unlike anything else! With this website, I hope that I can influence others to read more and to discover what kinds of books
      feel perfect for them!</p>
